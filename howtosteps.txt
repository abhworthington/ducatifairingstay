The process for making and installing is fairly simple. We break it into 3 steps: prepping parts, putting them together, and installing.

- Prepping parts
-- Print/machine upper fairing mounts (2) using STL file in repo or according to drawings in repo
-- Tap cylindrical section of mount w/ M6x1.0 tap, bottoming if possible
-- Cut two lengths of M6 rod to 130-135mm, clean threads

- Putting parts together
-- Thread upper mount completely onto rod. Use threadlocker if appropriate.
-- Thread jamnut onto opposite end, followed by balljoint assembly, thread to bottom of balljoint threading

- Installing
-- remove windshield screw, replace with 30mm M5x0.8 screw
-- slide upper mount over extended screw threads
-- retain with locknut and washer
-- remove screw attaching fairing mount to gauge cluster mount (take care not to drop nut on backside of the bolt)
-- spin balljoint assembly out to appropriate length, where stud/rod puts gentle tension on fairing
-- retain balljoint arm with nut
-- tighten locknut to balljoint
-- repeat on other side
